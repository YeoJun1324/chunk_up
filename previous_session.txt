> This session is being continued from a previous conversation that ran out of context. The conversation is
  summarized below:
  <analysis>
  Let me analyze the conversation chronologically to ensure I capture all key elements and technical details:

  1. Initial Context (Start of session):
     - The session began with a continuation from a previous conversation that had run out of context.
     - The previous conversation involved fixing multiple errors in a Flutter project.
     - We were given a summary of the previous conversation which detailed fixing API service classes, exception
  handling, and architecture issues.

  2. First Issue - API Key Not Found Error:
     - The user reported an issue where the app couldn't find the API key despite it being entered.
     - We identified the problem with the ApiService implementation: static methods were creating new
  LocalStorageService instances instead of using the injected service.
     - We modified the ApiService to use instance methods with the injected _storageService and added additional
  debugging code.
     - We created a test function to verify API connectivity.

  3. Second Issue - API 400 Error:
     - The user reported a 400 (Bad Request) error when calling the Claude API.
     - We added extensive debugging to ApiService to log requests and responses.
     - We found issues with the model name discrepancy between different files and fixed it.
     - We implemented a more robust error handling mechanism.
     - We updated the prompt structure for better API responses.

  4. Feature Enhancement - Character Source Material for Prompts:
     - The user wanted to improve the prompts by including original source material info for characters.
     - We modified the GenerateChunkUseCase to query CharacterService for character details.
     - We enhanced the prompt to include source material and character details.
     - We added instructions to maintain the writing style and tone of the original work.

  5. Feature Enhancement - Ability to Edit Chunk Title:
     - The user wanted to add the ability to edit chunk titles in the chunk_result_screen.
     - We identified that the edit functionality was partially there but needed improvement.
     - We added a dedicated title editing dialog with better user feedback.
     - We added a visual indicator (edit icon) to show that the title is editable.

  6. Feature Enhancement - Word Detail Screen:
     - The user requested changes to the word_list_detail_screen to number words and show chunks.
     - We created a new word_detail_screen.dart file showing detailed word information.
     - We modified the word list UI to add numbers and chunk indicators.
     - We implemented a deleteWord method in WordListNotifier.

  7. Feature Fix - Chunk Regeneration:
     - The user asked if the chunk regeneration feature was implemented.
     - We identified that it was implemented in chunk_result_screen.dart but used dummy data.
     - We modified it to use the actual API service for regeneration.
     - We added improved error handling and response parsing.

  8. Feature Enhancement - Word List on Result Screen:
     - The user wanted to enhance the chunk_result_screen with a word list display.
     - We added a section showing used words with indicators for words that have explanations.
     - We made the words clickable to show their explanations.

  9. Prompt Enhancement - Source Material Consistency:
     - The user requested to modify prompts to maintain consistency with source material.
     - We modified the GenerateChunkUseCase to emphasize maintaining style, tone, and world-building elements of
  the original source material.

  Throughout the conversation, we dealt with several technical challenges:
  1. Name conflicts between two ApiService classes
  2. Inconsistencies in model naming
  3. Issues with response parsing from Claude API
  4. UI enhancement requirements for better user experience
  5. Finding proper balance between static and instance methods

  The most recent task was enhancing the prompt in GenerateChunkUseCase to ensure consistency with source material
  for characters.
  </analysis>

  <summary>
  1. Primary Request and Intent:
     The user had multiple requests aimed at fixing errors and enhancing functionality in a Flutter application
  called "Chunk Up" for language learning. The main requests included: fixing an API key detection issue, resolving
   a 400 error in API communication, implementing a title editing feature, creating a detailed word information
  screen, enabling real API-based chunk regeneration, adding word lists to the chunk result screen, and finally
  enhancing the prompt to maintain consistency with character source material. The most recent request was
  specifically to modify the prompt to include instructions to maintain the writing style, tone, and world-building
   elements of source works when characters from those works are included.

  2. Key Technical Concepts:
     - Flutter and Dart for mobile app development
     - Clean Architecture pattern with separate layers (Core, Domain, Data, Presentation)
     - Service Locator pattern using GetIt for dependency injection
     - Repository pattern for data access
     - Claude API integration for AI-generated content
     - Provider pattern for state management
     - Named parameters for exception handling
     - JSON parsing and error handling
     - UI components including dialogs, bottom sheets, and cards
     - Singleton pattern for services

  3. Files and Code Sections:
     - `/home/duwns/chunk_up/lib/core/services/api_service.dart`:
       - Modified to use instance methods rather than static methods
       - Added extensive error logging and API response debugging
       - Added testApiConnection() method to verify API connectivity
       - Added fallback mechanisms for API failures

     - `/home/duwns/chunk_up/lib/core/utils/api_exception.dart`:
       - Updated to use named parameters consistently
       - Added error analysis functionality
       - Enhanced with better error reporting

     - `/home/duwns/chunk_up/lib/domain/usecases/generate_chunk_use_case.dart`:
       - Added CharacterService integration to fetch character details
       - Enhanced prompt construction with source material guidance
       - Most recently modified to include this instruction for character prompts:
         ```dart
         NOTE: Since this character comes from "${character.source}", you MUST maintain the writing style, tone,
  world-building elements, and setting details consistent with the original work. Pay careful attention to how
  characters speak, behave, and interact in that fictional universe.
         ```

     - `/home/duwns/chunk_up/lib/presentation/screens/chunk_result_screen.dart`:
       - Added title editing functionality with dialog
       - Implemented actual API-based chunk regeneration replacing dummy implementation
       - Added word list section to display used words with explanation status
       - Fixed import conflicts using alias (remote_api)

     - `/home/duwns/chunk_up/lib/presentation/screens/word_detail_screen.dart`:
       - Created new screen to show detailed word information
       - Implemented sections for word details, metadata, and associated chunks
       - Added UI feedback for word usage in chunks

     - `/home/duwns/chunk_up/lib/presentation/screens/word_list_detail_screen.dart`:
       - Enhanced word list UI with numbered entries
       - Added indicators for words used in chunks
       - Added options menu with edit/delete functionality

     - `/home/duwns/chunk_up/lib/presentation/providers/word_list_notifier.dart`:
       - Added deleteWord method for removing words from word lists
       - Implemented proper error handling for word operations

  4. Problem Solving:
     - Resolved API key detection issue by fixing the storage service injection pattern
     - Fixed 400 API error by addressing model name inconsistencies and improving error logging
     - Solved name collision between two ApiService classes using import aliases
     - Enhanced chunk regeneration by implementing actual API calls instead of dummy data
     - Improved JSON parsing resilience by handling different response formats
     - Added robust error handling with user-friendly messages

  5. Pending Tasks:
     - No explicitly pending tasks were identified at this point

  6. Current Work:
     The most recent work was enhancing the prompt template in the GenerateChunkUseCase to ensure that when
  characters from specific source materials are used, the generated content maintains consistency with the original
   work's style, tone, and world-building elements. This involved modifying the character details section of the
  prompt to add specific instructions for the AI to follow the conventions of the original source material.

  7. Optional Next Step:
     Since the task of enhancing the prompt with source material consistency instructions has been completed, and
  there are no explicit pending tasks, the next logical step would be to test the modified prompt with different
  character sources to verify the AI properly maintains source material consistency. However, this was not
  explicitly requested, so confirmation from the user would be needed before proceeding with any new tasks.
