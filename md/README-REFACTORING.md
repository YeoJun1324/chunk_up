# ChunkUp Refactoring Summary

## Improvements Made

1. **Restructured Project Architecture**
   - Implemented Clean Architecture with clear layer separation
   - Created proper folder structure with core, data, domain, and presentation layers
   - Added comprehensive ARCHITECTURE.md guide for future development

2. **Fixed Circular Dependencies**
   - Resolved circular dependency issues between components
   - Implemented proper dependency injection patterns

3. **Standardized Import Patterns**
   - Replaced relative imports with package imports
   - Organized imports by layer for better readability

4. **Created Missing Components**
   - Added repository interfaces for better abstraction
   - Implemented proper error handling and logging services
   - Created CharacterService to fix missing functionality

5. **Improved Dependency Injection**
   - Updated service_locator.dart with proper dependency registration
   - Aligned repositories and use cases with interface types
   - Added proper service initialization

6. **Fixed Package Configuration**
   - Corrected package name in pubspec.yaml
   - Removed invalid dependency entries

## File Structure

The project now follows this structure:

```
lib/
├── core/               # Core functionality used across all layers
│   ├── constants/      # App-wide constants
│   ├── services/       # Core services (logging, error handling, etc.)
│   └── utils/          # Utility classes and extensions
├── data/               # Data layer
│   ├── datasources/    # Data sources (remote, local)
│   ├── models/         # Data models
│   └── repositories/   # Repository implementations
├── di/                 # Dependency injection
├── domain/             # Domain layer
│   ├── models/         # Domain models
│   ├── repositories/   # Repository interfaces
│   └── usecases/       # Use cases (business logic)
└── presentation/       # Presentation layer
    ├── providers/      # State management
    ├── screens/        # UI screens
    └── widgets/        # Reusable widgets
```

## Future Improvements

1. **Update Import References**
   - All remaining imports across the application should be updated to use package imports
   - Example: `import 'package:chunk_up/core/services/api_service.dart'`

2. **Implement Proper Error Handling**
   - Integrate the new ErrorService throughout the application
   - Add proper error handling with user-friendly messages

3. **Complete Repository Implementations**
   - Update all repositories to implement their interfaces
   - Move business logic from repositories to use cases

4. **Add Unit Tests**
   - Create unit tests for repositories, services, and use cases
   - Add widget tests for the presentation layer
